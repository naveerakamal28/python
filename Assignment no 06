*QUESTION NO 1 :
    
Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
  
*QUESTION NO 2 :

One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.

*QUESTION NO 3 :

The main difference between them is that we make a method within the class where as a function can be made outside the class.

*QUESTION NO 4 :

~CLASS:
      
The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.

~OBJECT:

An Object represents an entity either physical (box), conceptual (chemical process), or software (list)

~ATTRIBUTE:

An Attribute is a named property of a class. It has a type. It describes the range of values that that property may hold.

~BEHAVIOR:

determined by how the object acts or reacts to requests (messages) from other objects
